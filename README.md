**Software testing project**

The files contain code for testing an existing math library, which I have worked on with another teammate.

1. We tried to implement Unit testing as a first way in trying to test the code 
2. then we changed to TDD
3. We worked with various tools for code coverage and formatting
4. created new features
5. Tested and used the new feature, and applied the necessary changed on the files to integrate it into the library

We wanted to understand the main differences and what improvements happened after applying each one of those testing ways.

**Just so you know**, the code in the file under the name **test** is our main contribution to this project.
