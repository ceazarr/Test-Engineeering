**Software testing project**

The files contain code for testing an existing math library which I have worked on with another teammate.

1. We tried to implement Unit testing as a first way in trying to test the code 
2. then we changed to TDD
3. And finally we worked with CLang-Tidy 

We wanted to understand the main differences and what improvements happened after applying each one of those testing ways.
